# discordemail
A relatively simple discord bot that can send and receive messages. 


## Setup
Change the bot token, password, email, smtp and imap server variables in the code with your own credentials.

Add the bot to your server (A private one I suggest).
Run bot.py.

### TODO
- Fix the fetch command so it actually works.  
- Add comments, clean up code.
